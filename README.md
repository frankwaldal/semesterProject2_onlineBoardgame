This application runs on port 8080 in its default setup, to change this, edit the value of `PORT` on line 5 in the `server.js` file, in the folder `backend`.

Ensure you have node and npm installed on your computer.

Do the following in commandline:
- Navigate to the `backend` folder.
- Run: `npm install`.
- Run: `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`.

To access the game, go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. (Change localhost with host/ip if accessing from different pc, and 8080 with choses port if changed.)
